(defun compare-pair (left right &optional (results nil))
  "Compare packets `left` to `right` using puzzle rules. If  `left` is
   determined to be 'bigger', return T else NIL.

   Rules:
   1) If both values are integers, the lower integer should come first. If the
      left integer is lower than the right integer, the inputs are in the right
      order. If the left integer is higher than the right integer, the inputs
      are not in the right order. Otherwise, the inputs are the same integer;
      continue checking the next part of the input.
   2) If both values are lists, compare the first value of each list, then the
      second value, and so on. If the left list runs out of items first, the
      inputs are in the right order. If the right list runs out of items first,
      the inputs are not in the right order. If the lists are the same length
      and no comparison makes a decision about the order, continue checking the
      next part of the input.
   3) If exactly one value is an integer, convert the integer to a list which
      contains that integer as its only value, then retry the comparison. For
      example, if comparing [0,0,0] and 2, convert the right value to [2] (a
      list containing 2); the result is then found by instead comparing [0,0,0]
      and [2]."
